\item {
Led effort to architect and develop Fulfillment Optimization (FO) simulation, generating 11\% increase in annual savings in NA or \$50M total EBIT in FY23, by using Python, Flask, ORTools, and PostgreSQL to allow for back-testing with 99\% similarity to production.
}
\item {
Spearheaded the value measurement for our team by designing a baseline, estimating FY23 savings with 8\% decrease in shipping costs while using 40\% less CO2 annually, through analysis with SQL, Pandas, and Snowflake.
}
\item {
Collaborated with lead data scientists to build a simpler and more powerful decision engine that satisfied all previous requirements and reduced shipping inefficiencies by 2\%, with an ORTools/Gurobi optimization model.
}
\item {
Integrated FO from NA to EMEA, enabling cost-saving strategies that saved approximately 5Mâ‚¬ for FY23 by altering our Python code-base, SQLAlchemy schemas/queries and building new algorithms.
}
\item {
Enabled Kubernetes/EKS distributed system to support horizontal scalability, facilitating the simultaneous execution of multiple experiments and scaling workers for each experiment. Generalized the codebase to enable local testing, debugging, and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.
